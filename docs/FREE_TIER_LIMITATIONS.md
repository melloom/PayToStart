# Free Tier Limitations & Workarounds

## What Free Users Can Do

### ✅ Available Features:
- **Create Contracts**: Up to 3 contracts (lifetime total)
- **View Contracts**: View all created contracts
- **Download PDFs**: Download contract PDFs
- **Manual Sharing**: Share contracts manually (download PDF and send via your own email)

### ❌ Not Available:
- **Email Delivery**: Cannot send contracts via email through the platform
- **Click to Sign**: Cannot use digital signature feature (requires email delivery)
- **Templates**: Cannot create or use contract templates
- **AI Generation**: Cannot use AI to generate contracts

## Why Free Users Can't Use Click to Sign

Click to Sign requires:
1. **Email Delivery** - To send the signing link to clients
2. **Email Delivery** is a paid feature (Starter tier and above)

Since free users can't send contracts via email, they also can't use the click-to-sign feature.

## Workarounds for Free Users

### Option 1: Manual PDF Sharing
1. Create your contract
2. Download the PDF
3. Send the PDF via your own email client
4. Client can print, sign, and scan/photo it back to you

### Option 2: Upgrade to Starter
- Get 20 contracts per month
- Email delivery included
- Click to sign included
- 7-day free trial available

## Signature Options

When sending contracts (Starter+ tiers), you can choose:

### ✅ Signature Required (Default)
- Client must type their full name
- Client can optionally draw a signature
- More formal/legal acknowledgment

### ✅ Just Type Name (Optional)
- Client only needs to type their name
- No signature drawing required
- Simpler acknowledgment process

**Note**: The "Require Signature" toggle is available in the "Send Contract" dialog when sending contracts via email.

## Upgrading

To unlock email delivery and click-to-sign:
1. Go to Dashboard → Settings → Subscription
2. Select Starter, Pro, or Premium tier
3. Start 7-day free trial (Starter+)
4. Immediately get access to email delivery and click-to-sign
