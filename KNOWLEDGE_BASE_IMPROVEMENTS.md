When generating a contract, the AI:

4. **Generates** contracts using best practices and examples
5. **Includes** appropriate clauses based on contract type

The enhanced knowledge base is automatically used when:
- Generating new contracts via AI
- Editing existing contracts
- Fixing contract issues

No additional configuration needed - just run the population script:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/populate-knowledge-base.ts
```
